# Confidently Transact with the Highest Degree of Anonymity

#### Private

Ryo was conceived with the highest levels of privacy in mind. Ring Confidential Transactions with minimum ringsize of 25 were implemented to conceal every transaction in Ryo network.
Following migration to [zk-proofs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ryocurrency/comments/f8utr2/updatem_ryo_currency_0500_fermi_paradox/) will make potential tracing of Ryo recipients even more impossible. Have piece of mind knowing that what you choose to do with your money is your business, not anyone else's.

#### Untraceable

As privacy is the core foundation of Ryo, sending and receiving addresses are encrypted and transaction amounts are obfuscated by default. Disposable ghost addresses conceal your real Ryo address from senders, allowing for truly anonymous and untraceable transactions. Our uniform payment ID system, makes transactions that use payment ID-s untraceable and hides the very fact that you use ID-s.

#### Decentralized

Ryo adds privacy to the core of Satoshi's vision of a decentralized, trustless cryptocurrency. Many other initially GPU oriented cryptocurrencies fell prey to centralization caused by ASICS/FPGA/BOTNETS.
Ryo will (as it has in the past) not allow this type of centralization to occur on its network through continued development of Ryo and its [Cryptonight-GPU](https://ryo-currency.com/cn-gpu/) algorithm.

#### Fungible

Ryo is truly fungible because of its built-in privacy features. Just like cash, nobody knows who had possession of any particular coin before them. Even better than cash, nobody knows the identity of who they're sending their coins to. It is extremely unlikely that Ryo will ever be blacklisted by any third party due to any association in prior transactions.

#### Anonymous

Ryo allows you to use a new ghost address for every transaction you receive. Never receive coins with the same address twice, even further reducing the astronomically tiny chance of you and your transactions to be traced.

#### Easy to Use

Our [Ryo Wallet Atom](https://ryo-currency.com/atom/) and [Web wallet Quasar](http://ryowebwallet.com/) are user friendly wallets that let you store, send and receive Ryo. They are available on both PC and phone platforms.
Our desktop wallet Atom is one of the most easy-to-use and intuitive wallets around and it also supports GPU [SOLO mining](https://solo-pool.ryoblocks.com/getting-started), view-only wallets and has many more features.

## Whitepaper & Academic Study

Ryo, as a fork of Monero which itself was initially based on the CryptoNote protocol, inherits all whitepapers and academic studies from CryptoNote and Monero Research Lab. Additionally, Ryo has pioneered technologies such as [Cryptonight-Heavy](https://github.com/ryo-currency/ryo-writeups/blob/master/cn-heavy.md) / [Cryptonight-GPU](https://ryo-currency.com/cn-gpu/) mining algorithms and Uniform Payment ID. Some of them are already used by numerous other Monero forks.
Additionally Ryo dev team has implemented [ECC library with multi-threading support](https://www.reddit.com/r/ryocurrency/comments/f8utr2/updatem_ryo_currency_0500_fermi_paradox/) in its core binaries that gives notable speedup to wallet blockchain scanning process.

## Development Path

This is the roadmap suggested by our developers but can be changed to reflect new project targets and the developer's vision. We don't have strict implementation timelines and are publishing timestamps of e vents that took place forming our track record.

We believe that named "decentralised" project in development means that any user can contribute his time to form ideas or doing actual help in any part of Ryo: either it is core code, infrastructure (wallets, pools, miner updates etc) or community help and marketing as well as advertising tasks. We would like to thank each and every [contributor](https://ryo-currency.com/faq/#3) that spent time in the past and currently spends time helping our active developers duo: Fireice_UK and Mosu_Forge.

**Ryo is primarily a technology focused project**, thus we do not spend large amounts of funds for marketing purposes. The founders believe that users looking for a higher level of privacy will seek out and find us. We encourage the community to speak about Ryo in their community.

Credit is due to the Monero Project. Without it Ryo would not be possible. Monero is a great project, but the Ryo Team believes we can create a more secure cryptocurrency by enabling higher ringsize from the start, implementing new private transaction system that retrofits to support old payment ID system.

Credit is also due to Nicolas van Saberhagen and the CryptoNote team for their original work on the cryptonote whitepaper, as well as the Bytecoin project for creating the first CryptoNote-based coin.
